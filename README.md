# Zero to App: Building a universal translator

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

Code from the Zero to App talk at [Cloud Next 2017](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/).

### Talk details

Firebase and Google Cloud Platform together help developers build extraordinary mobile and web apps. In this session, we'll craft an app live on stage and demonstrate how to create a great user experience using Firebase. We'll then extend this by calling into Cloud Platform APIs, without having to spin up servers or manage infrastructure. You'll experience firsthand how easy it is to build with Firebase, and how easy it is to scale with Google Cloud.
